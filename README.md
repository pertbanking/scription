# Scription

A tool for memorizing large, connected portions of the Bible.

_"For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover
the sea."_ -- Isaiah 11:9

## Purpose

I am developing Scription because effective Bible memory tools should be
readily available to everyone with access to the internet through their phone
or computer. If the internet offers an enticing connection to social media and
news outlets, it should also offer an enticing connection to the eternal book.

There are several good Bible memory tools that exist for free already:

- [Bible Memory App](https://biblememory.com/) (This is the one I currently use)
- [LearnScripture](https://learnscripture.net)
- [Verses](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/verses-bible-memory/id939461663)

However, none of them are specialized for long-form memorization. They are
designed to quiz users on one- or two-verse long sections that lack the
immediate context. Scription's goal is to force users to understand the
context. How? By memorizing the context.

Scription will encourage its users to memorize not just a chapter, but rather
an entire epistle, an entire gospel account, or an entire phophetic work.
